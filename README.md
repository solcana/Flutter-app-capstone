## TO DOs

- Add NAV BAR!!, that is present everywhere and takes user to necessary pages - feed (all logs), my logs (his logs), etc
- Add same functionality to each destination page option (city/ lake/ mountain/ beach)
- Add option to delete user profile -> for 2nd model crud add / delete
- Add comments CRUD
- ADD link_to & redirects on all pages
- Think some more on how to go about the category page - when is it logical for it popup --> maybe add functionality - view only mine, view all

- of course add styling
